01 This is a story about my uncle and aunt. And guess what? They're both called Pat!
02 Last year, Mum and Dad agreed I'd stay with Uncle-and-Auntie Pat during the summer holidays.
03 Uncle-and-Auntie Pat live at Wishing Well Farm, way out of town. 
04 It isn't an easy place to find. Dad must have driven straight past without realising.
05 Before long, we were completely lost, and had to ask the way.
06 We followed the man's long list of directions. We drove through one village.
07 We drove up a muddy track, and found Uncle-and-Auntie Pat feeding the animals.
